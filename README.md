## Figure replication Interface 
### Synopsis

In this project, the user will be able to replicate the figures included in 
article _________.  This involves running the appropriate models and plotting 
the correct output data that each figure requires. 

### Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

**How the Interface will reproduce journal figures:**
1) Prompt user on figure they want to reproduce
2) Code will select the appropriate models needed
3) models will run and create an outpus .csv file
4) The project will grab necessary output data from the .csv file and create variables
5) These variables (time, force, sarcomere length, etc...) will then be plotted (in python)

The plots created are intended to look precisely like the figures from the journal article; however, the python code can be adjusted to plot other variables.

### Motivation

This project gives the readers of _____ access to the models and data analysed in the article as well as an easy to follow interface in which they can choose the specific figure they want to reproduce.  

### Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

### API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

### Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

### Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
